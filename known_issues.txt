- erroneous syntax at the end of a number (ex: 3+6wduhcbuwrb) produces correct result ignoring the error
- Scientific notation does not support floating point exponent (ignores decimal part)
- left to right binding for power operator (should be right to left)
- Implicit multiplication is affecting integration function
- Nesting integration causes the process to hang (due to recalculation of the nested integral)
